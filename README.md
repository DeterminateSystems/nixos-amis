# NixOS with Determinate Nix AMIs

This repo houses the build logic for [Determinate Systems][detsys]' official [Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)][ami] for [NixOS].
Our AMIs are available for these systems:

| System      | Nix system name |
| :---------- | :-------------- |
| AMD64 Linux | `x86_64-linux`  |
| ARM64 Linux | `aarch64-linux` |

On both systems, the AMIs have these tools installed:

* [Determinate Nix][det-nix], Determinate Systems' validated and secure [Nix] distribution for enterprises.
  This includes [Determinate Nixd][dnixd], a utility that enables you to log in to [FlakeHub] from AWS using only this command (amongst other tasks):

  ```shell
  determinate-nixd login aws
  ```

  Once logged in, your AMI can access [FlakeHub Cache][cache] and [private flakes][private-flakes] for your organization.
  Note that there is no need to manage access tokens or keys, as Determinate Nixd uses [AWS Security Token Service][sts] for authentication.

* [fh], the CLI for [FlakeHub].
  You can use fh for things like [applying][fh-apply-nixos] NixOS configurations uploaded to [FlakeHub Cache][cache].
  Here's an example:

  ```shell
  determinate-nixd login aws
  fh apply nixos "my-org/my-flake/*#nixosConfigurations.my-nixos-configuration-output"
  ```

## Example

For a detailed example of deploying NixOS systems to [EC2] using the Determinate Nix AMIs, see our [demo] repo.

## Changelog

### epoch-1

This is an initial version of NixOS with Determinate Nix AMIs.

## Deployment

You can deploy [EC2] instances based on the Determinate Nix AMIs using a variety of tools, such as [Terraform](#terraform).

### Terraform

> [!NOTE]
> The Terraform configuration below is compatible with [OpenTofu] as well.

You can use our official AMI for NixOS in a [Terraform] configuration like this:

```hcl
data "aws_ami" "detsys_nixos" {
  most_recent = true

  owners      = ["535002876703"]

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["determinate/nixos/epoch-1/*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "architecture"
    values = ["x86_64"]
  }
}
```
